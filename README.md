# vnt2utf8.py

Python script to convert between base64-encoded Vnote files exported
from the Memo app that came with my Android phone and UTF8 text. Not
rigorously tested. Written by an inexperienced coder, may explode or
kill kittens. Dumps output on stdout and forgets it ever happened. No
special care is taken to ensure that converted text actually is UTF8.

License included inside the script.
